The Predator had a<br>history of similar problems with the variable<br>pitch propeller, according to the investigative<br>report. The Predator was 270 miles away from its<br>base when it experienced engine trouble. The crew<br>was ordered to crash the drone \"into tiny bits\" to<br>prevent it from falling into enemy hands. For the<br>same reason, the crew was directed to detonate the<br>Hellfire missiles in a remote location before<br>crashing the plane. As the crew prepared to shoot,<br>it realized that it was aiming too close to a<br>house. \"I called abort,\" the sensor operator<br>testified. \"I didn't want to fire into the<br>vicinity of the home.\"<br><br>Damage: $3,742,655<br>"
